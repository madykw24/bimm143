## PDB Statistics

Download a CSV file from the PDB site and open it: 
```{r}
PdbStats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
PdbStats
```

> Q1. What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
PdbStats$X.ray
PdbStats$EM
PdbStats$Total
((150342 + 8866 + 7911 + 2510 + 154 + 11 + 8534 + 1540 + 2681 + 74 + 6 + 0)/(171221 + 10444 + 10876 + 4025 + 191 + 22))*100
```
- 92.81% of structures in the PDB are solved by X-ray and Electron Microscopy. 

> Q2. What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
(171221 / (171221 + 10444 + 10876 + 4025 + 191 + 22))*100
```
- 87.01% structures are protein.

> Q3. Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

- 4,703 structures. 


## Visualizing the HIV-1 Protease Structure

### Using Mol\*

**The important role of water**

> Q4. Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

-   Because hydrogen atoms are so small, we are not able to see them in the structure.

> Q5. There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

- HOH 308 

Now you should be able to produce an image similar or even superior to Figure 2 and save it to an image file.

> Q6. Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain (we recommend "Ball & Stick" for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## Introduction to Bio3D in R

Bio3D is an R package for structural bioinformatics. To use it we need to call it up with `library()`

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

To read a PDB file we can use `read.pdb()`

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

-   198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

-   HOH

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

-   2

The ATOM records of a PDB file are stored in `pdb$atom`

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

**Note: Q10-Q12 were done on the lab handout**

# Comparative Analysis of Adenylate Kinase (ADK)

We will start our analysis with a single PDB id code (from the PDB database): 1AKE

First we get its primary sequence:

```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

Run a BLAST search:

```{r}
# Blast or hmmer search 
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

Make a plot:

```{r}
# Plot a summary of search results
hits <- plot(b)
```

```{r}
# List out some 'top hits'
head(hits$pdb.id)
```

Use these ADK structures for analysis:

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

Download all these PDB files from the online database

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

### Align and superpose structures

We will use the `pdbaln()` function to align and fit the identified structures.

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
pdbs
```


# Jump to PCA

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

`rmsd()` will calculate all pairwise RMSD values of the structural ensemble. This facilitates clustering analysis based on the pairwise structural deviation.

```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```

## Further Visualization

`mktrj()` can be used to generate a trajectory PDB file by interpolating along a give PC (eigenvector):

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```

-   You can open this file, pc_1.pdb, in Mol\*.
